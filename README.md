# Character-RNN-of-Shakespeare-Novel-using-LSTM

This notebook demonstrates how to generate text using a character-based RNN. I worked with a dataset of Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks. Given a sequence of characters from this data ("Shakespear"), train a model to predict the next character in the sequence ("e"). Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.

Dataset: We can download by running a single command provided along with code.

For usage purposes I have uploaded weights.
